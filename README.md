# PICKA â€“ Perception of Indexical Cues in Kids and Adults

PICKA is a test battery developed by the University Medical Center Groningen to evaluate the development of the perception of indexical cues through childhood.

## Results files

Each experiment is storing its own results in the form of a single MAT file per subject. These files are located in the `results` folder of each experiment, and should not be renamed or deleted. You should take a backup of these files regularly, preferably at the end of each testing session. One way is to copy the results back to the Google Drive folder, and let Google Drive upload them in the shared space. See "Backup the results" below.

**Renaming the file has no effect on the subject name!** See the section "Ensuring data consistency" for more details.

### Backup the results

To copy all results to the Google Drive, use the `save_results` function. Running this script will first export all results in SQLite and CSV formats, and copy all the MAT, SQLite and CSV files to the Google Drive. As soon as the computer is connected to the internet, the files will be uploaded.

It is a good idea to also make weekly copies of the whole PICKA folder on an external drive.

### Export formats

Each experiment folder contains an `export_results` script. With that script you can export results in three formats: SQLite, CSV or XLS.

__SQLite__ is a database format based on SQL that is ubiquitous on all systems nowadays. It is easy to import results in R, Python, or any modern data manipulation software. All data is exported into SQLite before being converted into another format. To view an SQLite file, you can use, e.g. Valentina Studio.

__CSV__ is comma separated values. It is widely recognized, including by Excel, R and Python. (Note that non-English Excel can sometimes struggle CSV files when the decimal separation symbol is a comma. In that case, LibreOffice provides a more reliable way of opening CSV files for visual inspection.)

__XLS__ files are provided here only for convenience. Remember that the data is not supposed to be manipulated manually, so only use Excel for visualisation.

### Ensuring data consistency

The experiments are coded in a way that prevents data to be overwritten or lost. If an experiment crashes in the middle, restarting it with the same participant ID will continue where it stopped. This ensures the robustness of the data collection, but has two downsides:

- The participant ID is extremely important. If there is a mix up, e.g. if participant John Doe is tested on day 1 with ID `nl_NHA003` but on day 2 with ID `nl_NHA008`, the experiment will either restart from the beginning; or if `nl_NHA008` already existed and had started the experiment, the data will get mixed in the result file with no way of knowing which one belong to which one apart from the date and time of testing. **So it is imperative to keep a lab book and an up to date list of the link between ID and name.** Also, it means that merely renaming the file will not solve the problem. The participant ID is stored in the file as well as in the filename. **Don't rename the files!**

- The result file contains all the options, which makes it self reliable, and prevents option details to be lost. However, if the option file (`*_build_conditions.m`) is modified during the experiment, the options for all the participants who had started before that will remain unchanged. What we gain in robustness, we lose in flexibility.

## Calibration

Calibration is an important part of any psychophysical experiment, especially when a population with hearing deficiencies is tested. The calibration procedure not only ensures that the experiment is repeatable, but also that the presentation level is appropriate for the listeners taking part in the experiment.

For PICKA, the aim of the calibration is that all stimuli are presented at a sound pressure level of __65 dB(A)__. This level ensures audibility in normal hearing listeners, as well as hearing impaired listeners using a prosthetic device.

To facilitate the calibration, PICKA comes with GUI gathering all the experiments. To start it, from the `Experiments` folder, just run:

```matlab
>>> calibration();
```

Then, take the following steps:

1. Set the volume of your computer to max. On Windows, there might be separate volumes for different applications: set Matlab and the System volume to max.

2. Play the sound through the equipment that will be used for the actual experiment (computer, soundcard, headphones/loudspeakers).

3. Measure the sound level from a KEMAR attached to a sound level meter.

4. Adjust the gain field so reach a level of 65 dB(A). Negative values will attenuate the sound. Positive values are forbidden as they would result in the clipping of some stimuli.

5. Once satisfied with all the gains, click "Save gains to files".

When calling the `calibration` function, Matlab will check that all the sounds necessary are present, and that the different stimuli used for an experiment have been equalised in RMS (i.e. all the sound files have the same RMS).
